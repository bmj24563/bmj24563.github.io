			<p class='font1'> Next on our trip was Rome, Italy! The food was TO DIE FOR and the shopping was endless. Not only that, but the history nerd in me came out! The Trevi Fountain, The Colosseum, The Vatican... I learned so much! You can see that we did a lot of time traveling to different historical places by the pictures you see. Our original plan was to visit other cities besides Rome but I'm so glad we didn't travel much. I would have loved to see other parts of Italy- and I hope one day I can- but I absolutley loved exploring all that Rome had to offer.</p>
