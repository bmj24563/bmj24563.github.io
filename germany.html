			<p class='font1'>Germany was the first stop on our trip! We stayed in Munich but traveled to other places like Halblech, Schwangau, Oberammergau, and Dachau. We even spent a day in Austria, specifically Salzburg and Saint Gilgen.The picture on the left is a picture from Neuschawnstein Castle. It is the castle that Cinderella's castle was inspired by. The middle picture is a picture of Tracy and I in front of the house that was used in The Sound Of Music- one of my favorite movies. The picture on the right is a picture of the lake in Saint Gilgen, home to Motzart's mother and the church used in The Sound of Music.</p>
