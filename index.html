			<p class='font1'>Hello! Welcome to a detailed description of my trip to <A href='germany.html'>Germany</A>, <A href='italy.html'>Italy</A>, and <A href='france.html'>France</A>! Specifically, my sister, my mom, my grandparents, and I traveled to Munich, Salsburg, Rome, and Paris. To learn about what we did in each country, click on that country! You will find pictures, itineraries, favorite memories, and descriptions of what we did/where we went.</p>
			<p class='font1'>Here is some background. My sister and I graduated from high school in 2018. My mom helped us plan a trip and we chose to go to Germany, Italy and France. We were in Europe for 2 weeks. We went to Germany first, then Italy, and then France before returning home. We chose Germany because my grandfather was stationed there for a really long time, Italy because my sister and I are OBSESSED with italian foods and culture, and France because I speak french and we had always dreamed of going to Paris.</p>
