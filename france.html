			<p class='font1'>Oh my goodness, do I love Paris! Hence the massive photo dump here, haha. I did not know just how much I would love it until I got there. I totally think I was a frecnh woman in another life. Unfortunately, my nana got a stomach bug on the first few days we were there. We made sure to get her a baguette and a bouquet of flowers every day until she felt better. It was overcast but we just missed the rain! One fascinating thing was the Eiffel Tower after if got dark. It was so beautiful. We got to see it on our last day in Paris. We also got to see the opera house that helped inspire Phantom of The Opera! I love <abbr title="Phantom of the Opera">POTO</abbr>! How cool is that? There are so many cool things about Paris, I don't think I can include them all without writing a novel! As someone who is learning French, it was really cool to get real practice in. At that time, I really only knew the basics. Now that I have more experience, I would love to go back and see if I could read and understand a greater portion of the people there.</p>
